### Original image

Originally, the photo you've seen on the homepage is the wallpaper of my phone. Because it's a really nice portait of me at the beach, with a beautiful sunset in the back. It has been a struggle to make it fit in the card of my homepage, because the with of the original was like 526 pixels, and that wasn't great for our website, so I spend an afternoon zooming and scaling the picture in the correct place. But now I'm happy with the result !

### The website

Using [this](https://www.fotor.com/features/comic-book-filter/) website, I was able to make a great filter. But the same website also helped me with editing the picture, for exemple on the preview of the website there is a red outline, that's from there !

### The secret picture

Do you know stories about an evil twin ? Well, I've created 2 images with the same website. The second one was the actual one, but the first one is a selfie of me in my school with a watermelon.. it was the end of the year and we needed to bring something to eat in the last hour, so me and my friends brought a watermelon ! Unfortunatly, the teacher didn't wanted melon juice, so I had to eat it at home with my family.. and on top of all that, the selfie was so bad, I couldn't use it this website, so you won't see it !
