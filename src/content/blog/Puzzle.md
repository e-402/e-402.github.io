The puzzle accessible in my homepage or clicking [here](https://e-402.github.io/game/) is a simple 15puzzle created with Unity as a WebGL application

# What is a WebGL build ?
WebGL (Web Graphics Library) is a JavaScript API that enables rendering of interactive 2D and 3D graphics directly within compatible web browsers, without the need for plug-ins.


Note: I never finished my game, as I am really bad with puzzles
