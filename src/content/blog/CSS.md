## What is CSS ?

CSS stand for Cascading Style Sheets, in other words:
"CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document.
CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed."


## Where did I use it ?

In my internship, I learned CSS for an entire morning, just for Markus to tell me "Hey, that's not the good thing to do, there was just a simple ligne to change". At the end, we used it to make the background of my IntroCard, in my homepage.
