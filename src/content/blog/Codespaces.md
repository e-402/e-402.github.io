# What are codespaces ?

GitHub Codespaces are computers hosted in the cloud. Imagine having your entire development setup—tools, extensions, and configurations—available instantly, without any local installation.

## Why is it important ?

- **Instant Onboarding**: When you join a project, you don't need to spend hours setting up your development environment. Just open a repository on GitHub, and Codespaces launches instantly with pre-configured settings. It's like stepping into a ready-to-go workspace.

- **Device Agnostic**: Whether you're on a powerful desktop or coding from an iPad. From a Linux installation or something else, Codespaces work remotly. Since they live in the cloud, you can code from any device with any installation only requiring an access to internet.
