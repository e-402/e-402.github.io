### Github, in 1 sentence

**GitHub** is a platform where developers collaborate to build software together. It's like a hub where they share and manage their code. 

## Key things about it

- **Version Control**: GitHub uses **Git**, a popular version control system. You can track changes to you code over time, collaborate on projects, and manage different versions of your software.

- **Repositories**: Developers put their code in **repositories** on GitHub. These repositories allow them to show their work, share with others, and receive feedback or help.

- **Collaboration**: GitHub enables collaboration through features like **pull requests**. Users can review each other's code, suggest improvements, and merge changes quickly.
