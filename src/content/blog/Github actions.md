## What is this thing ?

**GitHub Actions** is an **automation platform** that allows you to define workflows for your repositories. These workflows can be triggered by various events, such as **pushes**, **pull requests**...

### Why is it cool ?

You can't look at something like [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BitMorest/execute/master/screenshoot.png) and telling anyone it's not cool without lying ! Even after running more than 40 times my website, I still find the 1 min of commands running on my screen really nice.
